## Layers

### App
With “App” is meant the whole JavaScript application. In [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), for example, that’s the`src` folder.

### Packages
Next, think about which large logical blocks your app has/will have. Similar to [Bounded Context](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html) from DDD. A package could be considered as a separate, smaller application. Even bundled separately ([webpack chunks](https://webpack.github.io/docs/code-splitting.html)), because users of one package don’t necessarily will use another package. Examples are: _User Management package, Auction package, Security package, Administration package, Reporting package, Stock package, Catalogue package_…

Dividing your application into packages is only beneficial if you have a large application which you can clearly divide into logical sub-applications based on distinctly separated use cases / user roles. Otherwise, separating into modules (see below) should be enough. You could start with only modules and add the packages layer when your application grows.

Packages allow you to split a big problem into smaller problems so you can focus on particular aspects of the application, ignoring everything else.

### Modules
A module represents related code of a specific concept of a package. For example the _Catalogue package_ could have a _Product module_, a _Cart module_ and an _Order module_ . 
You should aim to reduce the coupling of related Modules by making the dependency between two Modules unidirectional. 
Every module has an _index.js_ file which serves as the entry point for other modules. This way, a module can choose which parts it exposes in its public API.
 
## Building blocks & relations

### Client side routing
Every _package_ is responsible for managing the routes to the _scenes_ inside. If you don’t have the _packages_ layer, your routes are defined in the _app_ layer. 
The Router maps routes to _scenes_.

### Scenes
Scenes are used by the Router. A scene is a React component with **no data, no behaviour and no presentation**. A scene groups containers and components, to create an application page.

### Containers
Containers are rendered by scenes, components or other containers. A container is a React component with **no data, no presentation and little or no behaviour**. Containers work as the glue between services, containers and components. Containers are sometimes referred to as _smart components_.

### Components
Components are the smallest building blocks of the application. Scenes, containers and other components can render these components.
A React component (preferably a [functional component](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/components-and-props.html#functional-and-class-components)) with **no data and no behaviour. Pure presentation/UI**. Sometimes referred to as _dumb components_ or _presentational components_.

### Services
Services are React’s [Higher-Order Components (hoc)](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/higher-order-components.html). Services provide data and behaviour to containers. Encapsulating data and behaviour in a _service_ instead of in a _container_ has the advantage of being very reusable inside your application. Especially if your project has both React and React Native code.

### REDUX Reducers, Actions, Action types and Selectors
Each module should maintain their own state and actions. Every action type is prefixed with the module’s name to avoid name collisions.

```js
// cart/actionTypes.js
export const ADD = ‘cart/ADD’;
export const REMOVE = ‘cart/REMOVE’;
``` 

In order to loosely couple your components to the state, it is a good practice to write a _selectors.js_ file where you provide an abstraction layer for your state. A selector function receives the state and returns a (calculated) state leaf.

```js
// cart/selectors.js
import { NAME } from ‘./constants’;

export const getCartItems = state => state[NAME].items;
```

Also, this allows other modules to access the _cart_ state without having to know the exact structure.

Only [Services](#services) should access the state, and pass the relevant data as props to the [Containers](#containers).

### REDUX Sagas
Reducers and action types should be plain functions and as simple as possible. Instead, use [redux-saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga) for your side effects and application flows.

[This stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34930735/pros-cons-of-using-redux-saga-with-es6-generators-vs-redux-thunk-with-es7-async/34933395#34933395) gives a good explanation of why you should prefer redux-saga over e.g. redux-thunk.

Sagas are tightly coupled to your module. They listen for certain action types and respond with new actions.

### REDUX Root reducer, Root saga, Store and Middleware
Modules should be able to control where they are mounted in the state. This way, a module selector is not coupled to the root reducer. 

```js
// rootReducer.js
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
import cart from ‘./catalogue/modules/cart’;

export default combineReducers({
  [cart.constants.NAME]: cart.reducer
});
```

### redux-form
[redux-form](http://redux-form.com/) helps reducing indeterminism caused by user input, by storing all inputs in the redux state. 

### react-redux-fetch
Building a large application probably means having many, many interactions with a back-end service. Writing action types, actions, reducers, sagas etc for every interaction requires a lot of effort and boilerplate code. [react-redux-fetch](https://github.com/hirviid/react-redux-fetch) provides a good abstraction for this.
